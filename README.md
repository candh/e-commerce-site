# How ? 
Well, it's a pretty big project so I can't really put up en entire documentation. Although it's not that complex. You should be able to find your way. Or just tweet me! [@candhforlife](http://twitter.com/candhforlife)


#Why ?
I made this site. Okay, cool. But I didn't know how to sell it. And tbh couldn't find any interested guys. So, It's kinda been living in my "www" folder. So, I decided to make it open source. 


# But really dude, give me some idea...
All you have to do setup your database. Just import the store.sql file in the setup dir. 

Next up, start a apache server on the folder and visit localhost in browser!
