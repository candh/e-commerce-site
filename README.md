**Note that some UI elements have been changed and it looks more cooler**

# How ? 
Well, it's a pretty big project so I can't really put up en entire documentation. Although it's not that complex. You should be able to find your way. Or just tweet me! [@candhforlife](http://twitter.com/candhforlife)


#Why ?
I made this site. Okay, cool. But I didn't know how to sell it. And tbh couldn't find any interested guys. So, It's kinda been living in my "www" folder. So, I decided to make it open source. 



# But really dude, give me some idea...
Well, you need to set up your database for it to work. I created a database dump. I contains all the information about the tables. Just create a new database name "store" or something and import the **store.sql file found in database** folder of the project. 

Next up, fire up a browser and visit **localhost/store** It *should* work
